Understanding operator precedence and associativity in JavaScript is crucial for writing code that behaves as expected and to avoid ambiguity in expressions. These concepts dictate the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.

1. Precedence:
   Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are executed in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

   For example, in the expression `5 + 3 * 2`, the multiplication operator `*` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`. Therefore, `3 * 2` will be evaluated first, and then the result will be added to 5.

   Some common precedence levels in JavaScript:
   - Multiplication, division, and modulus have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
   - Comparison and logical operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators.

   It's important to be aware of precedence to ensure that expressions are computed in the intended order. However, using parentheses can override precedence and explicitly define the order of evaluation.

2. Associativity:
   Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. For example, in the expression `a + b + c`, the associativity of the addition operator (`+`) is left-to-right in JavaScript. This means that the expression will be evaluated as `(a + b) + c`.

   Some operators, like assignment operators (`=`), have right-to-left associativity. For example, in the expression `a = b = c`, the assignment is evaluated right-to-left, so `b` is assigned the value of `c`, and then `a` is assigned the value of `b`.
