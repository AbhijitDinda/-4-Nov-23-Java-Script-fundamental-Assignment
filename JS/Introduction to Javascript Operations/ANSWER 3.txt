In JavaScript, operators are categorized based on the number of operands they work on:

1. Unary Operators:
   Unary operators are those that work with a single operand, meaning they operate on only one value.

   Examples of Unary Operators:
   ---code---
   // Unary minus (-)
   let x = 10;
   let y = -x; // y will be -10

   // Increment (++)
   let a = 5;
   a++; // a will be 6

   // Logical NOT (!)
   let isTrue = true;
   let isFalse = !isTrue; // isFalse will be false
   

2. Binary Operators:
   Binary operators work with two operands, performing operations between these two values.

   Examples of Binary Operators:
   ---code---
   // Addition (+)
   let sum = 5 + 3; // sum will be 8

   // Subtraction (-)
   let difference = 10 - 4; // difference will be 6

   // Multiplication (*)
   let product = 6 * 4; // product will be 24
   

3. Ternary Operator:
   The ternary operator is unique as it's the only operator that takes three operands, used for decision-making or conditional expressions. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on that condition.

   Example of the Ternary Operator:
   ---code---
   let age = 20;
   let allowed = age >= 18 ? 'Allowed' : 'Not Allowed';
   // If age is greater than or equal to 18, allowed will be 'Allowed', otherwise 'Not Allowed'
